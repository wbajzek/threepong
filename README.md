# threepong
Three-player variant of ping pong

## Basic rules:
* Like one-on-one [table tennis](https://pongworld.com/table-tennis-sport/rules), played to 21 points (or 11 if you must)
* The third player begins off to the side as scorekeeper
* When a player wins a point, he/she remains in play
* When a player loses a point, he/she trades places with the scorekeeper after the scorekeeper tallies the point
* The scores belong to the sides of the table, not the individual players
* Likewise, the current server is determined by the side of the table and not the individual players
* After each five points scored, serving switches to the other side of the table
* The scorekeeper is responsible for keeping track of which side serves
* The winner is the player on the winning side of the table
* The loser is the player on the losing side of the table
* The scorekeeper is also a loser

## Clarifications for players of [Dungeons and Pong](https://github.com/meetmicah/dungeons-and-pong):
* No dribbling
* One or at most two "self-passes" are acceptable if sufficiently panic-stricken
* The ball can be served from either quadrant on the server's side of the table, to either quadrant on the receiver's side
